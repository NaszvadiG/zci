<h1>ZCI Simple Web App with Codeigniter</h1>

Hi! First off all. Sorry for the English. I'm Anton Zekeriev Rodin (www.azr.es) Spanish Web Developer. This is my contribution
for Codeigniter Comunity. All this time I wanted to create a simple and standart web APP with CI. This app allow me to start any
site from something Standart.

This is a Zkeleton a Codeigniter APP that includes:

HMVC
Internalization Library
Very simple Auth Library (You can easy change it)
HTML5 and CSS3 very simple admin themplate
JQuery and JQuery UI

I'am currently working in some modules that can be added in one minutes... like catalogue, contact form, simple CMS system.
My Idea is not to build a CMS, is provide a Skeleton APP for start to build any web app.

The official site for this APP is www.zci.es
