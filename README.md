<h1>ZCI Simple Web App with Codeigniter</h1>
<h2>BETA 0.1</h2>

Hi! First off all. Sorry for the English. I'm Anton Zekeriev Rodin (www.azr.es) Spanish Web Developer. This is my contribution
for Codeigniter Community. All this time I wanted to create a simple and standard web APP with CI. This APP allow me to start any
site from something Standard.

This is a Zkeleton a Codeigniter APP that includes:

<ul>
<li>Codeigniter 2.1.4</li>
<li>HMVC for CI from Wiredesign</li>
<li>Internalization Library i18n (Now I'am working on Spanish and Russian translate)</li>
<li>Very simple Auth Library (You can easy change or replace it)</li>
<li>Twitter Bootstrap Template 3.0.0 RC1</li>
<li>JQuery 1.10.2</li>
</ul>

I'am currently working in some modules that can be added in one minutes... like catalogue, contact form, simple CMS system.
My Idea is not to build a CMS, is provide a Skeleton APP for start to build any web app.

The official site for this APP is <a href="http://www.zci.es">www.zci.es</a>
